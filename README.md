# AI Personal Representative for Your Portfolio

Welcome! This project is a **professional AI assistant** designed for personal websites, portfolios, and career landing pages. It acts as your intelligent representative: responding to visitors, logging interest, and evaluating conversation quality using the latest LLMs‚Äîall in your own professional voice, using your LinkedIn and career summary.

## üöÄ Features

- **Conversational AI**: Responds to visitors with rich, context-aware dialogue powered by GPT-4o-mini.
- **Tools Integration**: Uses built-in tools to log user interest and record unknown questions for future improvements.
- **Auto-Evaluation**: Each AI response is evaluated by a separate LLM for professionalism and context quality.
- **Push Notifications**: Instantly alerts you when potential clients express interest or ask unanswerable questions (via Pushover).
- **Retry Logic**: Failed responses are automatically retried with feedback to improve quality.
- **Web Chat Interface**: Easily interact via the Gradio web UI.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Profile Ingestion**: Reads your LinkedIn profile (PDF) and summary (text) for context building.
2. **Conversational Loop**: Visitors message your AI agent; it responds in your professional persona and engages with them.
3. **Logging User Interest**: Interested users are prompted for their name, email, phone, and notes; these are securely logged and you‚Äôre notified.
4. **Unknown Question Tracking**: Logs questions the AI cannot answer for your review and future context upgrades.
5. **Automatic Quality Control**: Every AI reply is reviewed by a dedicated evaluator model before being delivered.
